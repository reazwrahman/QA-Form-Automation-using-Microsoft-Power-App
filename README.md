# QA-Form-Automation-using-Microsoft-Power-App 
This project was done during my internship with TC Electric LLC, a New York City based construction company. I built a full-stack application for them in the Microsoft PowerApp Environment.  
This repository contains all the relevant files used to build the front-end, back-end, and files used to test the app.
